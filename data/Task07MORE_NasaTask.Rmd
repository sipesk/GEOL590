Today we are going to complete my own task of plotting storms from the nasaweather package based on the different catagories.


```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

#install.packages("nasaweather")
library(nasaweather)


storms <- nasaweather::storms

storms %>%
  group_by(year, type) %>%
  count() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n, color=type)) +
    geom_point()+
    labs(x="Year", y="Frequency")
    


```
Looking at the year with the most storms, which storm was the most desistating?

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


storms %>%
  filter(year=="1995", type=="Hurricane")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=day, y=wind, group = "name"))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap("name")+
  labs(x="Days", y="Wind(mph)")
  

#Find out what day of what month was the most vicious hurricane during Hurricane Felix's reign. 

#Felix <- storms %>%
#  filter(name=="Fleix")
  


```
